## General Notes

#### First-class functions

In programming language design, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen">first-class citizen</a> (also type, object, entity, or value) in a given programming language is an entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified, and assigned to a variable.

For example:
- In C, a function cannot be passed to another function as a parameter. So in C, functions are referred to as "second-class objects".
- In JavaScript, a function can be passed to another function as a parameter. Therefore in JavaScript, functions are first-class.
- In Clojure, a functional programming, functions are first class citizens. This means functions can be treated as values. They can be assigned as values, passed into functions, and returned from functions.
