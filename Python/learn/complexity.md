<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">Time complexity</a> | O(n): linear time  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity">Space complexity</a> | O(n): for each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated, i.e. the amount of memory needed to run the algorithm grows no faster than linearly at k*N.
