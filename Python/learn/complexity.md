<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">Time complexity</a> | O(n): linear time  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity">Space complexity</a> | O(n): for each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated, i.e. the amount of memory needed to run the algorithm grows no faster than linearly at k*N.

Hash table: it has a O(1) lookup time. See here: https://towardsdatascience.com/faster-lookups-in-python-1d7503e9cd38

Hash table is so important that it needs to be on the top of most coding interview questions!

hash() function - Python uses different hash function for different data type
